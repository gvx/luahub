LuaHub documentation
====================

Lua knows only tables, however JSON (which is used to communicate with the
GitHub API) has arrays and objects, so I'll be using those terms here for
clarity.

If you are uncertain how exactly the data returned is formed, you should take a
look at http://develop.github.com/, which gives more information about the API.

API reference
-------------

luahub.
	user.
		search(name) -> user_array, first_name
			Search for a user, returns an array of the results,
			which are objects.
			If there are any results, a string is returned as well,
			which is equivalent to user_array[1].name, which may
			aid simple uses of the API.
		show(name) -> user
			Returns user information on a named user. If there is
			no match, nil is returned.
