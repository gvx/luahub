LuaHub documentation
====================

Lua knows only tables, however JSON (which is used to communicate with the
GitHub API) has arrays and objects, so I'll be using those terms here for
clarity.

If you are uncertain how exactly the data returned is formed, you should take a
look at http://develop.github.com/, which gives more information about the API.

API reference
-------------

luahub.
	user.
		search(name) -> user_array, first_name
			Search for a user, returns an array of the results,
			which are objects.
			If there are any results, a string is returned as well,
			which is equivalent to user_array[1].name, which may
			aid simple uses of the API.
		show(name) -> user
			Returns user information on a named user.
	commits.
		list(user_id, repository, branch[, path]) -> commit_array
			Lists all commits of a certain branch of a repository,
			optionally only those pertaining a certain path.
		show(user_id, repository, sha) -> commit
			Gives information on a commit given by its sha hash.
	tree.
		show(user_id, repository, tree_sha) -> tree
			Returns a tree listing of a given tree id.
		full(user_id, repository, tree_sha) -> tree
			Basically the same as show, only returns more blob-
			related metadata.
	repos.
		search(query) -> repository_array, repo_name
			Performs a search query, just like the one on GitHub.
			If there are any results, the second return value will
			be the username and repo namee, suitable for uris, for
			example "gvx/luahub".
		show(user, repo, extra) -> repository_info
			It would be just luahub.repos.show(), but GitHub
			provides several specialized calls, to extract other
			metadata. Unless otherwise noted,
			luahub.repos.show(u, r, 'e') is equivalent to
			luahub.repos.show.e(u, r)
			Without the extra argument, it retrieves basic
			information on the given repository.
		show(user) -> repository_array
			Lists all public repos (if you are authenticated as
			that users, it lists private repos as well).
		show.
			collaborators(user, repo) -> collaborator_array
				Lists the collaborators of a given project.
				(Everyone with push access to that repository.)
			contributors(user, repo, show_anon) -> contrib_array
				Lists all contributors for a project. This one
				is different from the alternative from, because
				it has an additional argument, show_anon, that
				makes the function list anonymous contributors
				as well.
			network(user, repo) -> network_info
				Gives advanced network information, useful if
				you want to make your own network graph.
			languages(user, repo) -> languages_info
				Lists the programming languages used for this
				project, and how much they are used. 
			tags(user, repo) -> tags_info
				Lists tags in this project and which SHA they
				refer to. It returns an object with the tag
				name as key.
			branches(user, repo) -> branches_info
				Gives an object containing references to all
				branches of this repository. Works the same way
				as tags().
		watch(user, repo) -> nil?
			Start watching a repository. You must be authed.
		unwatch(user, repo) -> nil?
			Stop watching a repository. You must be authed.
		fork(user, repo) -> repo_info
			Fork a repository. Returns information of the forked
			repository. You must be authed.
		keys(repo) -> public_key_array
			Returns an array containing all public keys you have
			set up for a specific repository.
		pushable() -> pushable_array
			Returns an array of all repository you can push to that
			are not your own.
	blob.
		show(user, repo, tree_sha, path) -> blob_info
			Show information about a specific blob, located by
			user, repository, the tree for the specific commit the
			blob is located and the path to that blob.
		all(user, repo, tree_sha) -> blob_object
			Provides hashes from all blobs at a certain tree. The
			keys are the pathnames, and the values are the hashes.
		full(user, repo, tree_sha) -> blob_array
			While all() only provides the sha, full() lists some
			metadata of those blobs. blob_array[n].name gives you
			the pathname, while blob_array[n].sha gives you the
			blob's hash.
	tree.
		show(user, repo, tree_sha) -> tree_array
			Lists the contents of a tree with some metadata.
		full(user, repo, tree_sha) -> tree_array
			Lists the contents of a tree with some metadata. I
			guess this version supplies more metadata?
		full(user, repo, tree_sha) -> tree_array
	gist.
		To do.
	issues.
		To do.
